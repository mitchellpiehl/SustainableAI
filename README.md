# SustainableAI
This is the code for my website on Sustainable Artificial Intelligence. 
The website is intended to be a professional and modern website that shares the dangers of Artificial Intelligence and what current industry leaders are doing, or are planning on doing to address these issues. It looks at two different aspects of sustainable AI. Sustainable and Environmental.

The Environmental aspect talks about the large amounts of energy and water needed to train AI, while the Social aspect deals with the data required to train AI and how AI affects content creators and the workforce. It also discusses how AI can be beneficial for sustainability and help us reduce our environmental footprint.

This website was built as a final project for a web design class at the University of St. Thomas so there is a large emphasis on design features and website functionality.
