                <h1>Projects</h1>
                <p>These are some of my most significant projects that I have completed recently. All of these projects deal with various aspects of Artificial Intelligence. These projects have given me a broad expertise in the field of Artificial Intelligence
                    to prepare me to be a well-rounded researcher in the field and to ensure my future work can advance the common good.

                <h2>Solving Math Word Problems Using Estimation Verification</h2>
                <p>
                    Research Project focused on improving large language models abilities to solve math word probelms. 
                    I discovered a novel method that improved large language models abilities to solve math problems with accuracy roughly 2 percent better than previous best in the world. 
                    This method uses a estimation verification and rectification technique to ensure accuracy of equations generated by AI language models. 
                    A 14-page research paper describing my work and results has been submitting for publication.
